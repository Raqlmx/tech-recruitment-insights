# How to Be on Top of Job Adverts

Finding the right job quickly can make all the difference. Here’s how to stay ahead and make sure your application is noticed.

**1. Set up alerts**
- For every role you’re interested in, set up email or platform notifications
- This way, you get notified immediately when a new job is posted

**2. Check new roles daily**
- Focus on jobs posted in the last 24 hours
- LinkedIn has a section that only shows jobs posted in the last 24 hours — these are the ones most likely to give you a chance
- Recruiters often review the first 100 applicants, so applying early matters

**3. Apply early and strategically**
- Once a role has 50+ applicants, recruiters may not have time to read all applications
- Even if a job shows 500 applicants, usually only 2–3 are actually a strong fit for the role

**4. Understand job posting timing**
- Jobs posted 2–3 weeks ago often already have candidates in process
- Some remain active just in case the first choice doesn’t work out

**5. Reach out directly when relevant**
- If you feel 100% qualified, contact the recruiter directly
- Include a short briefing on why you’re relevant
- Attach your CV and politely ask if they are still looking

**Key idea:** Early, targeted, and relevant applications stand out. Applying late or without matching the job description is usually wasted effort.
