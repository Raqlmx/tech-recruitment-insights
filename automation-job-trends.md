# Automation and Jobs - What’s Happening?

Automation is changing the way we work. AI, robots, and smart software are taking over simple and repetitive tasks. Some jobs are shrinking, but others are growing, and new ones are being created.

Jobs More Likely to Shrink
- Data entry and basic admin, like filling spreadsheets, copying information, or scheduling
- Cashiers and checkout workers, because of self-checkout and automated systems
- Call centre and support roles that follow scripts
- Simple factory or machine work
- Basic transport tasks, such as repetitive driving

Jobs That Are Growing or Safer
- Tech roles such as developers, cloud engineers, and AI specialists someone has to build and maintain automation
- Healthcare workers including nurses, doctors, and therapists caring is human
- Teachers and trainers people still need to learn from humans
- Creative roles like marketing, design, and storytelling
- Managers and leaders handling strategy, decisions, and people

Big Picture
- Automation changes jobs rather than just taking them
- Routine tasks are the first to be automated
- Jobs that require thinking, creativity, people skills, and tech knowledge are more future-proof
- Many new opportunities are appearing in tech and automation-related areas

Summary
Automation means some roles shrink, but new jobs emerge, especially where humans are better than machines.
